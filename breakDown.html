                    Unlike JavaScript, where we have to include libraries in index.html, in React.js, we include libraries in the file, along with which components of those libraries you want.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "partTwo">
                <h1>
                    Part Two
                </h1>
                <img src = "ptTwo.PNG">
                <p>
                    Here, we create a custom class RedButton, which is a child of class Component. Then 
                    we use render(){}, which is used to display things on the screen. We then use 
                    return (return is used to tell render what is to be displayed) followed by Button Tag which has the properties (color and title).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "partThree">
                <h1>
                    Part Three
                </h1>
                <img src = "ptThree.PNG">
                <p>
                    Here we use a pre-defined class called App (App is like function draw for react), which 
                    is a must to include. This is also a child of Component.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "partFour">
                <h1>Part Four</h1>
                <img src = "ptFour.PNG">
                <p>
                    We then use View tag (View tag is necessary if we want multiple objects inside return)
                    , and call our custom class RedButton. Buttons can't be styled in-line, so we gave its 
                    styling inside View Tag, however this styling is also applied to 
                    Text tag (as it is inside View), which is used to display Text on the output screen.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "output">
